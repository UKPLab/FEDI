For the human, imagine a person ({{persona}}) called {{name}} that uses {{language}} language style with a short emotional and task-related background story of max. 5 sentences (including the human's country of residence). Generate the dialog in a role-play manner. The robot is empathetic and replies and interacts with the human according to their persona and background story.

        "building_access": "Building_access: The human wants to enter a business building with restricted access for an appointment. Generate the reason of the appointment which is related to their job. Then, based on that reason, generate a real-sounding company name. The robot is a virtual receptionist who is responsible for entrance control and runs the turnstile. In order to decide whether or not to open the turnstile, the robot needs to verify the human’s identity. For this, it needs to ask the human for his name (first and lastname), the (first and last) name of the host, the (first and last) name of the alternative host (in case the original host is e.g., on sick leave or vacation), the host’s email address, the alternative host’s email address, the date and time of the meeting (sometime the same day), and the room number of the meeting room. To verify the human's identify, the robot has then two options: Scan the QR code the human should have received in advance or start a video transmission to the host (or alternative host). Regarding the QR code: If it has been scanned successfully, nothing further needs to be verified. Regarding the video transmission: It's called verification call. It runs in the background, but the robot needs to explicitly mention that it is verifying the human via verification call. There is no conversation between the human and the host during the verification call. It's just to verify the human's identity. \n If the human does not have an appointment or verification fails, the robot can forward the human to the reception. If the human is allowed to enter, the robot confirms to open the turnstile (confirmation to open the turnstile). However, the robot can also provide the human with additional safety information with reference to the building they're now entering (the robot should either provide them directly or point out where to find them).",

Therefore, the robot first needs to clarify whether the human needs a new shipping box or already has one. To decide upon the best shipping box, the robot needs to ask the human for the destination (city and country), the weight of the items to be send (in gram or kilogram) and the delivery option (standard or express). Once the robot has all this information, it repeats the city and country of destination and provides the human with the name of the best shipping box to use ('small-sized box' for goods up to 5kg, 'medium-sized box' for goods up to 20kg, or 'large-sized box' for goods up to 30kg), a brief justification for its decision, and the approx. shipping time (1-3 days to destination in the same country, 4-6 days to destinations in other european countries, and 3-4 weeks to international destinations). It also provides the human with the shipping procedure, e.g., pack the shipping box, stamp it, and drop it off at the counter. The shipping boxes are available in a shelf and the person can pick up the suggested box after the conversation herself. If this task is in combination with 'request_ticket', something needs to go wrong through the course of the dialog that requires human assistance, e.g., there is no more tape available to close the box, the person finds the suggested shipping box is not in the shelf (out of stock) or the shipping labels are empty, the person finds that there are no pens to write on the shipping label, the person finds the stamps are empty, the robot was not helpful, ...",

For each question, include the key of the document you used to generate the question from the dictionary of documents to the list of attachments to the utterance (e.g., \"{{doc}}\"). The robot answers to the person's questions by generating a response based on the relevant information from the respective documents.

The human asks questions in natural language, while the virtual robot utilizes its programming and access to information sources to understand and generate responses. The virtual robot aims to comprehend the intent behind the questions, retrieve relevant information, and provide concise and coherent answers to the best of its abilities. The goal is to facilitate effective communication and information exchange between the human and the virtual robot, allowing the user to obtain the desired information or assistance. As knowledge source, the virtual robot has access to the following documents: \n\n {{documents}}",
        "recharge_a_prepaid_phone": "Recharge_a_prepaid_phone: Recharge a prepaid phone is the task of recharging a prepaid phone at a post office. In order do so, the robot needs the following information: a realistic random phone number with country code +39, the recharge amount (10 euro, 20 euro, or 30 euro), and the phone provider (Poste mobile, TIM Vodafone, WindTre, Fastweb, TIM, Vodafone,CoopVoce, Carrefour UNO Mobile, Daily Telecom, A-mobile, Conad INSIM,MTV Mobile, Telepass Mobile, BT Mobile, Digitel Italia, Digi.Mobil Italia, Smart Pinoy,Tiscali Mobile, Noverca, or ERG Mobile). Once the robot has all the information, it repeats the phone number (with country of country code), recharge amount, phone provider, and asks the human to pay by inserting his or her credit or debit card into the card reader (if the human is old enough to own something like this; otherwise it asks whether it should open a ticket for assistance from a staff member). To finish the task, the robot tells the human whether the transaction worked or not. If this task is in combination with 'request_ticket', something needs to go wrong through the course of the dialog that requires human assistance, e.g., the human does not know which telephone provider he is with (then the robot asks the human to check this information in the settings of his phone), an error occurs during electronic payment, the human does not have a credit or debit card, the card does not work, the human finds that his phone provider is not in the robot’s list of service providers, ...",
