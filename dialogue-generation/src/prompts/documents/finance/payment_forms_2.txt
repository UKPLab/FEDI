The white slip can be used for all payments to companies and institutions whose postal current account number is known; in this type of bulletin the fields must be completed in full, from the recipient up to the data indicating the transaction (number and reason for all). The F35 is used for payments due to the Revenue Agency when these are configured as tax bills or late or default payments. It can be recognized by the numerical code 123, shown at the bottom right. The RAV form shows the code 247 and is a pre-compiled bulletin; it is used in particular for the payment of taxes on government concessions, such as that for the urban cleaning service. The MAV form is one of the most widespread pre-compiled forms, the one used, for example, for payments due to the Public Administrations and for most university fees. It has the code 247 at the bottom right, but unlike simple postal payment slips, a MAV payment slip also has an identification code, made up of 17 digits, which allows each single payment to be uniquely identified. It is in fact a standard of interbank procedure, which concerns a transaction between banking institutions. Then there are so-called pre-marked bulletins, which are issued already partially or fully completed: we refer in particular to those identified with codes 896 and 674. The pre-filled TD 896 slip is a complete form that includes all details, such as the customer account number, name, amount due and other personal data related to you, the payer. These are issued in your name, and cannot be modified. The partially pre-filled TD 674 slip includes pre-filled information about the details of your payment, except for the amount that is due. These postal payment slips are often used for fines, or for situations where the amount you have to pay is not already known.
