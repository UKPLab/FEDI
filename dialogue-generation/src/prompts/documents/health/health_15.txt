If the insured had already signed an accident contract with Poste Assicura,which included permanent disability coverage due to illness and replaces itwith this contract without interrupting the previous one, the days of Deficiency are calculated on: new covers, other than those of the previous contract, and the part of the Sum Insured that exceeds the previous one. Are there cases in which the disease is not covered? All claims that occur in these cases are also excluded: wars also undeclared, general insurrections, military operations andoccupations and invasions, acts. The premium for each insured person is adjusted on the basis of age. Thenew premium is calculated by multiplying the premium previously paid bythese coefficients of adaptation: Age 21: +10%; Age 26: +36%; Age 31: +33%;Age 36: 30%; Age 41: +31%; Age 46: +18%; Age 51: +25%; Age 56: +28%; Age 61: +17%.

If the insured dies for reasons other than that which generated the disability and the compensation of the accident has not been ascertained, Poste Assicura can adopt one of these two criteria: pay a sum equal to the amount offered or agreed with the insured beforehis death; without an offer or agreement with the insured, pay an amount equal tothe estimate of the damage that emerges from the analysis of clinicaland medical documentation, carried out with the criteria of insuranceforensic medicine and these Conditions of Insurance; Persons can be assured that are under 65 years of age and reside in Italy. People can't be assured who are or have been affected by alcoholism, drug addiction, HIV infection and related syndromes with or without AIDS cannot be insured. If, during the insurance period, the insured person falls into one of the cases that cannot be insured, the policyholder or the insured must notify Poste Assicura in writing because this aggravates the risk. Poste Assicura may therefore withdraw from the contract with immediate effect, notifying the policyholder or insured party in writing within 30days of receipt of the notice or from the moment in which it became aware ofthe aggravation of the risk. Claims occurring after the occurrence of one of these cases and before withdrawal by Poste Assicura are not eligible for compensation.
